Advantages:
 
HIGH LEVEL,INTERPRETED:it is easy to understand program code,it is a high level language
it is free and open source
OBJECT ORIENTED
dynamically typed language
PORTABLE:it runs on all major OS Microsoft Windows,Linux
MODULAR:it has many standard library modules for a variety of tasks

Disadvantages:

slow Speed

Data types:

Integer
Float
Strings
List
Dictionary
Tuple

String:
A string is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed with in Single or double quotes
format character:
\n-new line
\t-tab
first character of a string starts with 0
you can also count index of string from ending which starts with -1
Strings can be indexed,sliced to retrieve particular characters from a string and stepped

string methods:
find
replace
index
count
startswith
endswith
split
strip
strings are immutable

List:lists are ordered collection of data
list of items should be enclosed in square brackets
once list is created i can add,remove items from the list so lists are mutable
methods:
append:adds elements to the list
insert:adds element at a particular position
extend:Concatenates elements to the end of the list,extend method takes a single argument
del:del elements in the list
functions:
cmp(l1,l2)-compares two lists
len(l1)
max(l1)
min(l1)
list(seq)-converts a tuple into list
list comprehension are a precise way for creating lists
syntax consists with brackets of an expression followed by a for clause then followed by zero or more for or if clauses..
result will be the new list after evaluating all the for and if clauses

tuple:tuple is sequence of data
tuples should be enclosed in paranthesis
tuples are immutable but we can take portions of tuples and create new tuples
to remove an entire tuple use del statement

dict:dictionaries are key value pairs
keys are unique in a dictionary while values may not be
values of dictionary can be of any type while key of dictionary should be string,numbers and tuples.
even if there is a duplication of the key the last key assignment wins and dict keys are case sensitive

if a key-value pair is to be deleted use del statement

dict functions

cmp(d1,d2)
len(dict)
str(dict)
type(dict)
dict.has key(key) returns true if there is key
dict.items()-returns a list of ke-value pairs
dict.keys()
dict.update(d1)
dict.values()
method
get(key,value=none)-gets the value of particular key
dict.from keys(seq,val)-seq needs to be used for preparation of dict keys and val needs to be used for tht keys
